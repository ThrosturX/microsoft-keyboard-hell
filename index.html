            <h2>The Manifesto</h2>
            <p>This is not a support forum. This is a graveyard. If you are here, you have likely spent 4 hours reading ten-year-old threads about "USB Polling Rates" only to realize the hardware is just fundamentally broken.</p>
            <p>Below are the stories of those who fought the hardware, and lost.</p>

                    <h3>The Sculpt Ergonomic Incident</h3>
                    <p>It started with a missed keystroke. Then a lag spike. I thought it was interference from my router. I moved the router. I bought a USB extension cable. I wrapped the dongle in tinfoil like a lunatic. The keyboard laughed at me. It disconnected right in the middle of a `git push`.</p>

                    <h3>Surface Keyboard Lag</h3>
                    <p>Why does a $100 keyboard have worse connectivity than a $5 garage sale find? I reinstalled Windows for this. I literally reinstalled my operating system because I thought it was a driver issue. It wasn't.</p>

                    <h3>The Dongle Died</h3>
                    <p>They told me the dongle is encrypted to the specific serial number of the mouse and keyboard. So when the dongle died, the entire set became e-waste. This should be illegal.</p>
